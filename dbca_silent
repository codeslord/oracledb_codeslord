Creating Database Using DBCA Silent Mode

To create a database using silent mode you need to pass in the keyword “silent” as an argument to DBCA command. The other options like password for SYS and SYSTEM, which template to use and where to put data files etc. are also provided to the DBCA as an argument.

Most of the options are optional and you can skip them. But if you miss the mandatory option the DBCA command line will ask for their values before creating database.

Below is an explanation for some of the parameters which we will be used to create a database.

-Silent

Will instruct the database configuration assistant to run in silent mode

-CreateDatabase

The argument will instruct the DBCA to create a database.

-TemplateName

The argument will specify the template that DBCA should use to create the database. Advantage of specifying a template is that you don’t have to specify the many other options like data file and control file locations.

The Database configuration assistant will get those values from the template. Although you can change the defaults of template during the initial steps.

-gdbname

The global database name is provided using this argument.

-sid

The database instance name which will be created and started as part of process.

-responseFile

You can also create a response file.

-characterSet

The character set that the newly created database will be using.

-memoryPercentage

The argument will specify the percentage of total memory that can be use by Oracle SGA and PGA combined.

-emConfiguration

Whether the database should be configured to use Enterprise Manager or not. Valid config types are LOCAL, CENTRAL, NOBACKUP, NOEMAIL, and NONE.

Now that you have an idea of what options are available you can use the commands below to create the database in silent mode.
$ echo $ORACLE_BASE
/u01/app/oracle
$ echo $ORACLE_HOME
/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1
$ dbca -silent -createDatabase -templateName General_Purpose.dbc -gdbname dbase -sid dbase -responseFile NO_VALUE -characterSet AL32UTF8 -memoryPercentage 20 -emConfiguration NONE
Enter SYS user password:

Enter SYSTEM user password:

The database has been created and started successfully.
Verify Database Creation

To verify that database has been created and is up and running you can use the following commands after logging in using SYS.
$ export ORACLE_SID=dbase
$ echo $ORACLE_SID
dbase
$ sqlplus / as sysdba
