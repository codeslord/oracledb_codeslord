 Session status is KILLED but no cleanup
Today morning I killed some sessions which were INACTIVE for very long time (select * from v$session where LAST_CALL_ET/(60*60*24) > 1000) which was demanded by our application admin.

I killed those session and those sessions were marked KILLED (STATUS field of v$session). After 5 hours i checked those session again and found that those are still in v$session and status='KILLED'.

Then I used a query, joining v$session(paddr) with v$process(addr) to find OS process id(v$process.spid), but no rows were returned.
Then, checked v$transaction view to check whether any rollback is going on-

select s.sid,
s.program,
t.status as transaction_status,
s.status as session_status,
s.lockwait,
s.pq_status,
t.used_ublk as undo_blocks_used,
decode(bitand(t.flag, 128), 0, 'NO', 'YES') rolling_back
from v$session s, v$transaction t
where s.taddr = t.addr;

But there was no rollback going on.
After that I used below query to find status of waiting session-

select *
from v$session_wait
where sid in (select sid
from v$session
where username = 'USERNAME'
and status = 'KILLED');

This time I found my sessions in waiting state with wait_time=0, so, oracle is waithing for instructions from user/clients and I have to stop/kill client program/process.
But there was no corresponding row for those killed session in v$process (as paddr in v$session has been changed after those session and sessions were in waiting state).

So, I used below query to find and kill any unwanted process which don't have any corresponding entry in v$session-

SELECT spid
FROM v$process a
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM v$session b WHERE b.paddr = a.addr);

I knew that I am using DEDICATED server, killing one process no impact on other (as no one is sharing that session). I also knew that those session were connected using TNS from remote machine.
So, before killing each process, I checked with `ps -ef|grep ` and if I found LOCAL=NO, then I killed the process.
After killing every process I waited for a while and checked in v$session fir one of KILLED session had been gone.
